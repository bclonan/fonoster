This document will guide through the installation process of Fonoster in a self-hosted environment or the cloud. You will learn about the available installation options and which one is the best for your current journey with Fonoster.

## Self-hosted or Cloud

There are several considerations to decide which deployment method to use. The main factors you should consider are costs and availability. Running the server in a cloud environment will likely be more stable than a home Internet connection. The cloud also gives you the advantage of not worrying about physical servers, electricity, etc.

However, running a local server might be a good option, especially while exploring Fonoster if you have stable Internet with good bandwidth.
